=== Menu Setup ===

WordPress menus can be found under Appearence -> Menus.					
					
* You'll need to create at least one new menu for the header. Pocket also supports a custom menu, which you could use in the widget area. Click the + to add a new menu.					
					
* Now, on the left hand side, select the pages you would like to have added to the menu. You can then click "Add to Menu" and they will show up on the right side of the page. You can drag the pages around to arrange them the way you'd like.

* Create a drop menu by dragging menu items under and to the right of another menu item.
					
* To create the Search toggle icon, create a Custom Link with the URL of # and a label of Search and add it to the menu.
					
* Once add to the menu, toggle the menu item open and add a class of search-toggle. See this image for reference: http://cl.ly/JqDT. If you can't see CSS Classes, open the Screen Options tab (upper right hand side of screen) and turn them on.
					
* Save the menu when finished.
									
* Now that you have both menus created, you need to assign them in the Theme Locations window located on the left. From the drop down menu, select the appropriate menu for the header and footer and save.
					


=== Using the Theme Customizer ===

Pocket is customizable via the WordPress customizer. Here, you can set a custom background image, upload a logo and set your link/accent color.

* To access the theme customizer, click Appearance in the WordPress admin menu.

* Under the Current Theme at the top of the page, click Customize.

* You should now be in a live preview of Pocket, with the customizer on the left.

* Use the various menus to set the site title and description, background, logo, accent/link color and more!

* When you're finished making changes, click Save & Publish to save the settings.

* Check out your site to confirm your changes.



=== Widgets ===

The sidebar/widget section of Pocket is in the footer, available via a toggle. Add widgets to the Footer Widgets pane to see them in the footer of the theme. You can add text widgets, the Twitter widget, custom menus, etc. here just like I did on the demo. Or don't, whatever.



=== Creating Image and Video Posts ===

Pocket makes it easy to share your images and videos. Follow the instructions below to add a variety of media posts.



=== Featured Image Posts ===

* Create a new post and add a title and description.

* Write your content and add whatever styling you want.

* On the right hand side of your page, you'll see the Featured Image pane. Click Set Featured Image and upload your image. Once uploaded, scroll down and click Use as featured image. Once set, you can close the image upload window.

* Once you've added the featured image and content you can publish and preview your post.



=== Video Posts ===

Create a new post and add a title and post content.

* Next, scroll down the page a bit and look for the Custom Fields box. If you don't see the Custom Fields box, look up towards the top of your screen and click the Screen Options drop down. Make sure Custom Fields is checked.

* Now you can add the Custom Field. The Name is going to be video and the value will be your embed code. See this image for reference: http://cl.ly/JqYH. Click Add Custom Field.

* Once you've added the custom field and content you can publish and preview your post.



=== Quote Post ===

* Create a new post and add a title and description.

* To add the large quote, simply write or paste the quote in the editor window. The text will auto format to large block letters with a dark background.

* To add a cite name, write the name below your text and set the font in bold. This will tell the theme that it's the cite and will size and style it smaller. See this image for a sample of how to add a quote properly. http://cl.ly/JrS8

* On the right hand side of your page, you'll see the Format pane. Click Quote to set the post format.

* Once you've added your quote and selected the Quote format you can publish and preview your post.



=== Post Styles ===

Pocket comes with a few custom element styles, which are used to easily add extra styling to your WordPress posts. To use the post styles, simply select your text and then select from the Styles drop down which style you would like to apply. You'll be able to see the changes live, in your editor.

Intro Title - As seen on the demo, this is a nicely styled block of text to introduce your page. Similar to blockquote styling.
